		<h1>Directory Image Resizer Example</h1>
		<p>The directory image resizer provides a simple way to to resize images, both local and remote, with clean inline commands and tidy URLs. But showing is easier than explaining, so lets start with this image of a somewhat disgruntled monkey.</p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/monkey.jpg" alt="Disgruntled Monkey" width="407px" height="400px" />
			<a href="./images/monkey.jpg">./images/monkey.jpg</a>
		</div>
		<p>Maybe he just doesn't like having his picture plaster so big on a website. I know, lets make it smaller, say, 80px by 80px, that would work will for an avatar or something.</p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/80x80/monkey.jpg" alt="Disgruntled Monkey" width="80px" height="80px" />
			<a href="./images/80x80/monkey.jpg">./images/<span>80x80</span>/monkey.jpg</a>
		</div>
		<p>Much better, he's still disgruntled, but at least he's not so in your face about it. It can also handle remote images as well, for that take a look at these cute little puppies.</p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="http://i.imgur.com/5bMbobU.jpg" alt="Cute Puppies" width="960px" height="540px" />
			<a href="http://i.imgur.com/5bMbobU.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/5bMbobU.jpg</a><br/>
			<i>Note: This image is displayed at 50% scale.</i>
		</div>
		<p>Adorable. But we need a square image, and one thats not quite so large, never fear DIR is here.</p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/600x600/http://i.imgur.com/5bMbobU.jpg" alt="Cute Puppies" width="600px" height="600px" />
			<a href="./images/600x600/http://i.imgur.com/5bMbobU.jpg">./images/<span>600x600</span>/http://i.imgur.com/5bMbobU.jpg</a>
		</div>
		<p>Oh No! That puppy on the left is getting cut in half, luckily we can do more than just crop the image, lets we what options we have.</p>
		<div class="type">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="./images/200x200d/http://i.imgur.com/5bMbobU.jpg" alt="Cute Puppies Distored" width="200px" height="200px" />
				Distorted
			</div>
			<div class="image">
				<img src="./images/200x200p/http://i.imgur.com/5bMbobU.jpg" alt="Cute Puppies Padded" width="200px" height="200px" />
				Padding
			</div>
			<div class="image">
				<img src="./images/200x200n/http://i.imgur.com/5bMbobU.jpg" alt="Cute Puppies Nearest" width="200px"/>
				Nearest
			</div>
			<div class="image">
				<img src="./images/200x200c/http://i.imgur.com/5bMbobU.jpg" alt="Cute Puppies Cropped" width="200px" height="200px" />
				Crop
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Wonderful, lets go with nearest<p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/600x600n/http://i.imgur.com/5bMbobU.jpg" alt="Cute Puppies Nearest" width="600px"/>
			<a href="./images/600x600n/http://i.imgur.com/5bMbobU.jpg">./images/<span>600x600n</span>/http://i.imgur.com/5bMbobU.jpg</a>
		</div>
		<p>Excellent. But sometimes the image is only a little bit off the dimensions you want, and a little bit of distortion isn't a big deal right? We have a "fuzziness-factor" programmed in for that. it defaults to 10% but can be adjusted in the resize script. Lets see how that works, we have two examples below.</p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/little-bit-taller.jpg" alt="Running Water"/>
			Little bit Taller
		</div>
		<br/><br/>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/little-bit-wider.jpg" alt="Desert Mountians"/>
			Little bit Wider
		</div>
		<p>Those are both just a tad under 10% larger one direction than the other, by default the "fuzziness-factor" is 11%, so when we try and turn them into perfect squares they will get distorted to do so, it's just a little bit, so it's hardly noticeable.</p>
		<div class="type">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="./images/455x455/little-bit-taller.jpg" alt="Running Water" width="455px" height="455px" />
				No Longer Taller
			</div>
			<div class="image">
				<img src="./images/455x455/little-bit-wider.jpg" alt="Desert Mountians" width="455px" height="455px" />
				No Longer Wider
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>You can also use the images original size as a value when giving the image a new size. This is good for things like banners, lets say you want a banner thans 500px wide, but don't really care about the height. can pass it a value like <span>500xan</span> where a is the automatically calculated height of the image and n sets it to the nearest image size possible. This will resize the iamge to be 500px wide and whatever that would need to be in height in order to contain the whole thing. Lets use this image as an example</p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/crossroad.jpg" alt="Crossroads" width="1000px" />
			<a href="./images/crossroad.jpg">./images/crossroad.jpg</a>, 1000px by 562px
		</div>
		<p>We can turn it into a 500px by whatever it needs to be banner like this</p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/500xan/crossroad.jpg" alt="Crossroads" width="500px" />
			<a href="./images/500xan/crossroad.jpg">./images/500xan/crossroad.jpg</a>
		</div>
		<p>Passing the height as a (for <u>a</u>uto) and setting to output the image using the nearest resizing method we created a banner of variable height as needed. You can then give thid iamge a width alone letting the image resize vertically as needed (and horizntally in the case of HiDPI support). You can also replace the vertical size with a for the same effect vertically.</p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/ax250n/crossroad.jpg" alt="Crossroads" height="250px" />
			<a href="./images/ax250n/crossroad.jpg">./images/ax250n/crossroad.jpg</a>
		</div>
		<p>If you looking for a large backgroud image you can also use the letter "f" for full-screen sizing. This will use the users <em>screen</em> dismensions. This is used as opposed to the viewport dimensions so that if the browser window is resized the image will still look as shark and as crisp as possible. With this any image can be used as a size appropriate splash image. For example the below image should be the same size as your screens resolution, complete with DPI adjustments. <em>Note: The iamges displayed on this page are scaled to fit, click the link below the image to get the full size version. Additionally the source image is rather large, if the iamge did not load try vewing it another tab to ensure it did not run out of memory while attempting to resize it.</em>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/fxf/vegetables.jpg" alt="Vegetables" width="1000px" />
			<a href="./images/fxf/vegetables.jpg">./images/fxf/vegetables.jpg</a>
		</div>
		<p>But what about images with transparencies you ask, well look at fry, just to give someone some money.</p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/trans-bg.png" alt="Take Fry's Money" width="1000px" />
			<a href="./images/trans-bg.png">./images/trans-bg.png</a>
		</div>
		<p>we can resize that down to a nice little square and keep those transparent backgrounds, this time we'll use the padding method<p>
		<div class="image">
			<img src="./images/300x300p/trans-bg.png" alt="Cute Puppies" width="300px" height="300px" />
			<a href="./images/300x300p/trans-bg.png">./images/<span>300x300p</span>/trans-bg.png</a>
		</div>
		<p>In addition to resizing however you like Directory Image Resizer also caches resized images to save time. The cache image will always be loaded unless it's source has changed, which is checked with a simple MD5 comparison. Other features include support for HiDpi Devices with a tiny bit of javascript to get the users Pixel Ratio. One thing to remember is that if you are using the retina support your going to have to give your images a width and/or height so they don't go all out of proportion and mess things up, but your doing that already right?</p>
		<p>If you want to use the Directory Image Resizer, read more about it in it's real documentation, or just want to poke around it's insides, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/pgooch/dir" target="_blank">right here on GitHub</a>.</p>
